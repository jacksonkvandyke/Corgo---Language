Corgo is a small, experimental, human‑friendly programming language designed around clarity, modularity, and extensibility. Its core philosophy is simple: make code approachable, readable, and adaptable across different natural languages.

Corgo is currently in early development, with a working lexer, a language‑pack system, and a growing parser/runtime.
